Use a 7805 for 5V. You should think about using a LM1086 for getting 3.3V.
Look at the 7805/LM1086 datasheet for C1 and C2 values.

P4 (CONN_2) is the battery connector.

K1 and K2 are input and output for the PSP audio jacks.

X1 is 16MHz. See the crystal's datasheet for C3 and C4 values.

R1 and R2 can be 1 to 10kOhm

P1 goes to PSP.

P2 goes to TV jack.

P3 goes to controller.

Use resistors for the LEDs D1 and D2.



Tips:
Get a PSP TV out extention cable and cut it in two parts for getting a PSP SIO
jack and connector. The cable of "DragonElectronics" works great.
Get a PS2 controller extention cable for getting a PS2 jack.
