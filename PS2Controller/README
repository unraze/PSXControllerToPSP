This is an attempt of connecting a PS2 controller to a PSP with neithermodifing the controller nor the PSP.
It works by converting the PS2 controller (SPI) signal to a UART signal. The code is very bad because
I'm a bad developer and I didn't care about it as long as it was working. It's your turn to improve the code.

The PSP plugin has a single known bug. It freezes when suspending and resuming the main thread. That means
you can not suspend and resume the PSP and contine playing then. It needs to completely re-load the plugin.
Getting it fixed is your turn either.
